 Abstract
Augmented Language Models (ALMs) em-
power large language models with the ability
to use tools, transforming them into intelligent
agents for real-world interactions. However,
most existing frameworks for ALMs, to vary-
ing degrees, are deficient in the following crit-
ical features: flexible customization, collab-
orative democratization, and holistic evalua-
tion. We present Gentopia , an ALM frame-
work enabling flexible customization of agents
through simple configurations, seamlessly in-
tegrating various language models, task for-
mats, prompting modules, and plugins into a
unified paradigm. Furthermore, we establish
GentPool , a public platform enabling the reg-
istration and sharing of user-customized agents.
 Agents registered in GentPool are composable
such that they can be assembled together for
agent collaboration, advancing the democrati-
zation of artificial intelligence. To ensure high-
quality agents, GentBench , an integral compo-
nent of GentPool , is designed to thoroughly
evaluate user-customized agents across diverse
aspects such as safety, robustness, e fficiency,
etc. We release Gentopia on Github1and will
continuously move forward.
 1 Introduction
There is a burgeoning trend in research towards
augmenting large language models (LLMs) with
external tools, enabling them to access up-to-date
databases (Jiang et al., 2023; Pan et al., 2023), per-
form arithmetic operations (Imani et al., 2023),
navigate websites (Gur et al., 2023), develop soft-
ware (Wu, 2023), etc. This integration of tools
marks a departure from traditional language mod-
eling, heralding a new era of intelligent agents ca-
pable of interacting with the real world.

proposed to build tool-Augmented Language
Models (ALMs), or "agents", including Au-
toGPT (Richards, 2023), SuperAGI (Kondi,
2023), HuggingGPT (Shen et al., 2023), GPT-
Engineer (Osika, 2023), LangChain (Chase,
2023), Semantic Kernel (Callegari, 2023), and
MiniChain (Rush, 2023). Each of these methods
is deficient, to varying degrees, in the following
critical features.
 •Adaptive Customization : Many are designed
for a single set of tasks without extensive sup-
port in customization, or they involve redun-
dant and boilerplate implementation that un-
necessarily complicates agent tuning.
 •Tool-augmented NLP Benchmark : A user-
customized agent, before registration, is ex-
pected to go through a thorough evaluation
to ensure its quality. However, there is a lack
of comprehensive benchmarks designed for
agent evaluation in the aspects of e fficiency,
safety, robustness, etc.
 •Democratization : A platform where user-
customized agents can be registered and
shared is missing. This hinders the interaction
and collaboration of various user-customized
agents. Collaborative growth is a critical point
toward safe and powerful intelligence.
 This paper proposes Gentopia , a lightweight and
extensible framework for the research on ALMs.
 Gentopia allows practitioners to customize an
agent with a single configuration file, greatly sim-
plifying the process of building, tuning, sharing,
and evaluating agents. Various language models,
task formats, prompting modules, and plugins are
integrated into a unified paradigm, without loss
of flexibility for agent customization. In addi-
tion, we believe the collaboration between user-
customized agents can contribute to the democ-arXiv:2308.04030v1   [cs.AI]  8 Aug 2023

principally designed to assemble an agent instance from a Y AML configuration file, composed of multiple pre-built
agent components such as the LLM, tools, memory, and external agents; 2) GentPool : a platform engineered to
facilitate the registration and sharing of specialized agents, seamlessly integrating GentBench , an ALM benchmark

ratization of AI. Hence, GentPool , a platform
for agent registration and sharing is established.
 Agents registered in GentPool can be hierarchi-
cally assembled together, enabling the collabora-
tion of multiple agents. GentPool is accompa-
nied by a unique benchmark, GentBench , that can
probe customized agents with a holistic evaluation
in terms of safety, robustness, e fficiency, multilin-
gual capabilities, etc. Notably, it is flexible for
users to customize the evaluation by configuration.
 2 Background
A variety of agent projects have been proposed,
targeting an array of diverse tasks, including auto-
mated web navigation (Gur et al., 2023), database
management (Jiang et al., 2023), automated game
playing (Wang et al., 2023), collaborative soft-
ware development (Wu, 2023), etc. Meanwhile, re-
searchers are enthusiastically developing generalist
agents that can perform well for multiple tasks. Au-
toGPT (Richards, 2023) stands for the first experi-
mental open-source application for fully automatic
AI, with the ultimate goal of “autonomously achiev-
ing whatever goal users set". SuperAGI (Kondi,
2023) provides a more user-friendly interface, im-
proved memory management, optimized token us-
age, and looping detection heuristics. Hugging-
GPT (Shen et al., 2023) expands the potential of
artificial intelligence by linking to extensive AI
models hosted on HuggingFace, thereby support-
ing a range of AI tasks in diverse domains and
modalities, including language, vision, and speech. However, given the unique requirements and
customization that each specific domain demands,
tools and prompting paradigms developed for a par-
ticular task may prove irrelevant or ine ffective for
others. This poses a significant challenge to the
development of a single, all-encompassing agent
that performs e fficiently across all tasks. Conse-
quently, there is a rising need for the collabora-
tion of multiple specialized agents. For example,
MetaGPT (Wu, 2023) models the entire process of
software development with carefully orchestrated
standard operating procedures (SOPs) to generate
longer program codes for game development. In
our work, Gentopia provides smooth support for
the composition of agents, which is handy for agent
collaboration in di fferent scenarios.
 3 Design and Implementation
Gentopia aims to provide easy assembly, sharing,
and interaction of task-specialized agents. A sin-
gle step to improve agent capability and e fficiency
gives plural contributions to interacted agents, fos-
tering collective growth toward greater intelligence.
 3.1 Rationale
The impetus of Gentopia is rooted in the aspi-
ration to construct capable and deployable AI as-
sistants. A pertinent question that arises in this
context is whether there is a necessity for a massive
and expensive model like 175B GPT-4 to perform
relatively simple tasks such as summarizing a web
search. Recent studies like TinyStories (Eldan and

 Li, 2023), Specializing Reasoning (Fu et al., 2023),
Let’s Verify Step by Step (Lightman et al., 2023),
and ReWOO (Xu et al., 2023), direct our atten-
tion towards an intuitive yet undervalued observa-
tion – LLMs exhibit enhanced capabilities when
a context /distribution shift is created, specifically
narrowed towards certain target tasks.
 However, there is no silver bullet for agent spe-
cialization. Various strategies can be employed
depending on target tasks. For instance, prompting
"Let’s think step by step" in context leads to more
accurate math reasoning (Kojima et al., 2022). Pro-
viding few-shot examples could guide an ideal exe-
cution workflow. Instruction tuning allows an LLM
to excel on fine-tuned datasets or tasks (Wei et al.,
2021). Tweaking the agent type from ReAct (Yao
et al., 2022) to ReWOO significantly reduces the
execution time of observation-agnostic tasks like
search & summarize.
 The design of Gentopia is deeply grounded in
our belief to share specialized agents for collective
growth. Gentopia presents an easy and portable
way to build agents, facilitating the reproduction,
enhancement, and interaction of agents. A compan-
ion platform, GentPool , is used to register pub-
lic agents, coupling each with a descriptive Wiki
page to help users navigate and search for agents
in need. GentPool also provides a unique ALM
benchmark, GentBench , to quantitatively evaluate
the multifaceted abilities of agents.
 3.2 Assembling Agents
At its core, Gentopia embodies each customized
agent as a single yaml config file, which can be
sent to AgentAssembler to create a corresponding
agent instance. An agent instance acts similarly
to a language model, where users can use “run”
or “stream” to get completed or incremental com-pletion. Besides, we build a clean and intuitive
Command Line Interface (CLI) allowing users to
“chat” with the agent in an interactive way. Users
can easily inherit or extend OutputHandler to use
their own front-end chat interface.
 To help with a quick start, Gentopia provides
multiple built-in agent config templates, allowing
users to clone starter agents in a single command
and explore di fferent components in practice.
 3.3 Adaptive Customization
The agent configuration file encapsulates the criti-
cal components of an agent, including:
•Basic Attributes . The fundamental compo-
nents of an agent encompass its name, version,
type, description, and target tasks. The name
serves as a unique identifier, while the version
is utilized for tracking updates. The agent’s
type delineates its interaction paradigm with
plugins. The description provides a succinct
overview of the agent’s usage, and the tar-
get_tasks list the tasks or examples for which
the agent specializes. These descriptions can
be selectively used in-context for agents to
recognize each other upon interaction.
 •LLM is a pivotal component that drives the
agent’s behavior. It is typically a dictionary of
the model_name and parameters. Gentopia
supports a variety of OpenAI LLMs and over
10 kinds of HuggingFace open-source LLMs
(including Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), Al-
paca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang
et al., 2023), Falcon(Almazrouei et al., 2023),
Flan (Wei et al., 2021), MPT (MosaicML NLP
Team, 2023), and more), each with a unique
set of tunable parameters and usage costs. No-
tably, Gentopia unifies support in both CPU

the agent type to instruct the LLM in-context.
 Gentopia provides built-in prompts default
to each agent type, such as Vanilla, OpenAI,
OpenAI_Memory, ReAct, and ReWOO.
 •Plugins enable agents to interact with exter-nal tools or other agents, thereby extending
their capabilities beyond single language mod-
els. Gentopia also allows agents to be built
in a hierarchical architecture, such that those
closer to the leaves are supposed to be increas-
ingly specialized and narrowed to more gran-
ular sub-tasks.
 •Memory allows LLMs to retrieve informa-
tion out-of-context. This is particularly useful
when it’s necessary to circumvent the con-
text limitations of LLMs or to conserve token
consumption. Implementation details are de-
scribed in the appendix.
 3.4 Agent Evaluation Benchmark
GentBench is a unique benchmark for agents or
ALMs. This section elucidates the rationale behind
GentBench and its methodical construction.
 3.4.1 Objectives
Due to the massive need of training datasets, re-
searchers and organizations tend to use public NLP
benchmarks, such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al.,
2020), MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), Big-
Bench (bench authors, 2023) to enrich the LLM
training corpus. Such methods inevitably introduce
evaluation bias when the entailed agents are tested
against the same set of tasks at inference.
 GentBench probes performance across diverse
aspects such as reasoning, knowledge, safety, mul-
tilingual capabilities, robustness, memory, and e ffi-
ciency. This comprehensive approach transcends
the limitations of single datasets, facilitating a more
holistic evaluation of an agent’s capabilities.
 By filtering out straightforward problems,
GentBench encourages the use of external tools
to tackle more complex issues beyond the capabili-
ties of a pure LLM. Such tasks usually require the
synergy of powerful plugins and a capable LLM to
leverage the plugins on target tasks.
 3.4.2 Benchmark Construction
The construction of GentBench involves an exten-
sive collection and curation of tasks, and a meticu-
lous process to filter out less challenging problems.
 The gpt-3.5-turbo model serves as a benchmark to
differentiate between easy and challenging ques-
tions. Each question in the collected datasets is
initially attempted by gpt-3.5-turbo. Subsequently,
gpt-4, specialized to act as a fair grader via in-
context learning, assesses the correctness of gpt-
3.5-turbo’s answer. This rigorous evaluation results
in a refined dataset composed solely of the chal-
lenging problems where gpt-3.5-turbo fails to solve
independently.
 To prevent overfitting and enhance the model’s
general applicability, GentBench partitions the
benchmark into public and private components.
 The public component fosters model development
with open access, while the private component is
exclusively for agents to be merged into GentPool ,
testing the generalized abilities of the agent on
unseen tasks. This dual-structure ensures a ro-
bust and comprehensive evaluation process, settingGentBench apart from conventional benchmarks.
 3.4.3 EvalPipeline
GentBench employs a range of specialized agents,
known as "graders", each designed to cater to dif-
ferent evaluation needs, including binary outcomes
(GatedGrader), continuous scoring (ScoreGrader),
pairwise outcomes (DojoGrader), custom measure-
ments (InstructedGrader), and unit test execution
(CodeGrader). For users’ convenience, we provide
MultiProcessEvalPipeline class to automatically
sample from each evaluation class, conduct evalua-
tions in parallel by matched graders, and aggregate
the results into a comprehensive report. We also
integrate our evaluation results with Zeno (Cabrera
et al., 2023), a powerful visualization tool assist-
ing users in collecting nuanced insight into the
strengths and weaknesses of agents.
 3.5 Collective Contribution
As an open-source project, Gentopia actively
encourages users to contribute their specialized
agents to GentPool . Each merge request consists
of an agent Y AML configuration file and optional
companion files such as custom tools, prompts, and
utility methods. Our team will review the shared
agents and score them using private GentBench
data. Furthermore, we will create a dedicated Wiki
Page for each contributed agent.
 Once the agents are incorporated into Gentopia ,
users can utilize built-in commands to clone or call
it for downstream use cases, fostering a dynamic
and collaborative environment. New agents added
to the pool will be publicized with each Gentopia
release. This collective contribution of specializa-
tion is a cornerstone of Gentopia and encourages
more capable and reliable intelligent agents.
 4 Case Study
We briefly showcase the process of building an
agent, who acts as an experienced and visionary
entrepreneur, for the users to create business plans
with the help of Gentopia . Further, the users can
evaluate the created agent and share it publicly into
theGentPool .
 4.1 Initializing an Agent
Figure 3 illustrates a concrete workflow for work-
ing with agents in GentPool . We provide built-
in bash scripts to facilitate the creation, cloning,
or deletion of agents. GentPool registers tem-
plate agents for each built-in agent type, allowing

 users to clone, for instance, the "react_template"
to start o ff. An agent instance simply contains an
"agent.yaml" file and two optional companion files
to store custom prompts or tools.
 4.2 Custom Configuration
Users can configure essential components of the
agent such as name, description, target_task, plu-
gins, etc. For instance, shown in Figure 3, users
can use the prompt template of ‘PromptOfElon’
and GPT-4 for constructing the LLM component.
 They can also add plugins (e.g., ‘google_search’
and ‘web_page’) to boost the agent. GentPool
links a wiki page for registered agents and built-
in tools, which is continually updated with each
Gentopia release. Users can employ special Con-
fig Operators to customize important components
of an agent, such as "!prompt" for customizing
prompt_template, "!tool" for self-defined tools as
plugins, "!include" for sub-agents as plugins, "!file"
to read local files in text format, and "!env" to read
an environmental variable.
 4.3 Testing and Evaluation
There are two methods to assess the performance
of a new agent: qualitative human evaluation and
quantitative GentBench evaluation. Users can call
"assemble.py" to initiate a CLI chat interface and
converse with the target agent. Alternatively, users
can use "evaluate.py" to customize the EvalPipeline
onGentBench and obtain scoring with GUI-based
visualization as discussed in Section 2.4.3.4.4 Agent Specialization and Publication
Users can employ various methods in agent spe-
cialization, improving agent performance and ef-
ficiency. These approaches include in-context
 prompt tunings like using few-shot examples, fine-
tuning a specialized LLM on desired tasks or
datasets, optimizing component configs such as
trying new agent types and other sub-agents, and
improving the capabilities of tools. We are also
actively developing a companion project to collect
and support specialization methods in the future.
 Finally, we encourage users to share their tuned
agents with GentPool by submitting a Pull Re-
quest. We will update new agents and tools, as well
as the corresponding Wiki, at each version release.
